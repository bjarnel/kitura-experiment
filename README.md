# kitura-experiment

This is a little Experiment with Server Side Swift.
In this app I have implemented a simple REST API in Swift, using the Kitura framework from IBM and a Swift wrapper for the mysql c-library form Perfect.
A certain file with database connection strings has been intentionally ommitted from github :-)
