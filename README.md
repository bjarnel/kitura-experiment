# kitura-experiment

This is a little Experiment with Server Side Swift.
In this app I have implemented a simple REST API in Swift, using the Kitura framework from IBM and a Swift wrapper for the mysql c-library from PerfectlySoft.
A certain file with database connection strings has been intentionally ommitted from github :-)

The background for this, is me tring to figure out if it makes sense for us (TV 2) to use Swift in a server-side capacity.
